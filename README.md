The code assumes all the data are present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code necessay to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of step 5 is called `averagesdata.txt`.
